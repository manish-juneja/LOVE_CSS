LOVE_CSS
========

This is a simple css html file which doesnot use any javascript or any of its libraries
(jquery or mordernizer) but  has a fantastic layout .I will continue to add more and more features with time .


Runs best on mozilla firefox and chrome.Unfortunately google chrome may have stopped supporting webkit in
favour of blink.
